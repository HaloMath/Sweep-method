Sweep method for solving Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations (SLAE)

The sweep method is a special case of the Gauss method and is used to solve systems of linear equations with a tridiagonal matrix. Such a system, in particular, is obtained by constructing a cubic interpolation spline. But let's take a closer look at the problems from physics that lead to such a configuration, and with ways of solving ...
